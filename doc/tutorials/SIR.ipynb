    "Coronavirus COVID-19 is a pandemic that is spreading quickly worlwide. Up to the 29th of March, there are 666,211 cases confirmed, 30,864 deaths and 141,789 recovered people worldwide. Governments and citizens are taking quick decisions to limit the spread of the virus and minimize the number of infected and deaths. These decisions are taken based on the experts opinion, which justify their claims based in the results of predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is an effort to decrease the access barriers to state of the art yet simple models that can be used to take public policy decisions to limit disease spread and save lives. \n",

    "## SIR model\n",
    "\n",
    "Most epidemic models share a common approach on modelling the spread of a disease. The SIR model is a simple deterministic compartmental model to predict disease spread. An objective population is divided in three groups: the susceptible ($S$), the infected ($I$) and the recovered or removed ($R$). These quantities enter the model as fractions of the total population $P$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S = \\frac{\\text{Number of susceptible individuals}}{\\text{Population size}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I = \\frac{\\text{Number of infected individuals}}{\\text{Population size}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = \\frac{\\text{Number of recovered or removed individuals}}{\\text{Population size}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a pandemics infects and kills much more quickly than human natural rates of birth and death, the population size is assumed constant except for the individuals that recover or die. Hence, $S+I+R=P/P=1$. The pandemics dynamics is modelled as a system of ordinary differential equations which governs the rate of change at which the percentage of susceptible, infected and recovered/removed individuals in a population evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of possible transmissions is proportional to the number of interactions between the susceptible and infected populations, `$S \\times I $`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\alpha SI.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\alpha$ is the reproduction rate of the process which quantifies how many of the interactions between susceptible and infected populations yield to new infections per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population of infected individuals will increase with new infections and decrease with recovered or removed people. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\alpha S I  - \\beta I, $$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\beta I. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `$ \\beta $` is the percentage of the infected population that is removed from the transmission process per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early stages of the infection, the number of infected people is much lower than the susceptible populations. Hence, $S \\approx 1$ making $dI/dt$ linear and the system has the analytical solution $I(t) = I_0 \\exp (\\alpha - \\beta)t$.\n",

    """
    Calculates the confidence interval of the parameters
    using the random sample bootstrap method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : open-sir Model instance
        A Model instance, such as SIR or SIRX

    t_obs : list or np.array
        List of days where the number of infected
        where measured

    n_I_obs: list or np.array
        List with measurements of number of infected people
        in a population. Must be consistent with t_obs.

    population : integer
        Population size

    alpha : numerical scalar, optional
        Percentile of the confidence interval required

    n_iter : integer, optional
        Number of random samples that will be taken to fit the model
        and perform the bootstrapping. Use n_iter >= 1000.

    Returns
    -------
    ci : numpy.array
        Numpy array with a list of lists that contain the lower and upper
        confidence intervals of each parameter.
    p_bt : numpy.array
        list of the parameters sampled on the bootstrapping. The most
        common use of this list is to plot histograms to visualize and
        try to infer the probability density function of the parameters.

    Notes:
    -----------
    This traditional random sampling bootstrap is not a good way to bootstrap
    time-series data , baceuse the data because X(t+1) is
    correlated with X(t). In any case, it provides a reference
    case and it will can be an useful method for other types
    of models. When using this function, always compare the prediction error
    with the interval provided by the function ci_block_cv.

    Parameters:
    -----------

    model: a open-sir model instance
        The model needs to be initialized with the parameters and
        initial conditions

    t_obs : list or np.array
        List of days where the number of infected

        List with measurements of number of infected people

    population : integer
        population size

    lags : integer, optional
        Defines the number of days that will be forecasted to calculate
        the mean squared error. For example, for the prediction Xp(t) and the
        real value X(t), the mean squared error will be calculated as
        mse = 1/n_boots |Xp(t+lags)-X(t+lags)|. This provides an estimate of the
        mean deviation of the predictions after "lags" days.
        alpha: percentile of the CI required

    min_sample : integer, optional
        Number of days that will be used in the train set
        to make the first prediction.

    Returns:
    --------
    mse_avg : float
        Simple average of the mean squared error between the model
        prediction for "lags" days and the real observed value.

    mse_list : numpy array
        List of the mean squared errors using (i) points to
        predict the X(i+lags) value, with i an iterator that
        goes from n_samples+1 to the end of t_obs index.

    p_list : numpy.array
        List of the parameters sampled on the bootstrapping as a
        function of time. A common use of this list is to plot the
        mean squared error against time, to identify time periods
        where the model produces the best and worst fit to the data.
